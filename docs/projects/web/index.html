  <h2 id="undiscovered-guide">Undiscovered Guide</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.undiscoveredguide.com">Undiscovered Guide</a> is a travel website I created with my partner while we were travelling, to help others explore our favourite parts of the world.  It&rsquo;s pretty popular, getting over 30,000 monthly page views.
<img src="/Words/images/ug.JPG" alt="Undiscovered Guide">
It&rsquo;s a completely custom web platform (no Wordpress or similar) which allowed us to create more useful travel guides than traditional blogs, and there&rsquo;s a lot going on under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frontend is written in Scala, transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS.  This convoluted approach let me do a lot of cool code sharing with the backend.</li>
<li>Parts of it are a dynamically-created single page app.  There&rsquo;s all sorts of cool widgets such as interactive maps dotted over the site.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a fairly complex backend content management system (CMS), written in Scala and with its own UI transpiled in ScalaJS, using PostgreSQL for data storage.  It has too many features to list: a full Google rank tracker, a Wikitravel parser, bots for both Pinterest and Twitter, batch processing of images, a booking.com &amp; Agoda accommodation browser (view all their hotels for a location on a map, filter by various criteria and add them to lists), and plenty more.</li>
<li>The CMS includes a custom HTML-like language, with its own handwritten parser.  This let us convert all prices into the user&rsquo;s currency, amongst other features.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s all self-hosted so I&rsquo;m now all too familiar with the joys of maintaining memory-hungry JVM processes on constrained server hardware&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="travelpouch">Travelpouch</h2>
<p>My partner and I needed a way to track our daily travel expenses, along with tracking who owed who what across a variety of currencies.  So Travelpouch was born, a web-based finance tracking app that is great for personal tracking and budgeting, and has some great features for couples and friends that holiday together and need to split expenses fairly.</p>
<p>The backend and frontend are both in Scala, with the frontend transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS.  There&rsquo;s also an Android app, written in Scala.</p>
<p>This was my first web project and went through several tech iterations while I explored different web tech stacks, including Grails (which is Groovy+Spring), then Angular, then its current version.  I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the current Scala+ScalaJS stack, which I&rsquo;ve used now on multiple projects and allows very productive code sharing, but I have my eye on Kotlin+KotlinJS as a successor.</p>
<p>We use Travelpouch daily, but it&rsquo;s a bit rough around the edges so is presently closed source and not generally available.
