<b>Split the Bill</b> is an Android app, written in Scala and ~~[published on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splitthebill&hl=en)~~ (have now removed as I lacked time to keep it maintained).

This app's not going to win any design or complexity awards, and was more of a successful hobby project to learn Android development and publish an app in a few days.

It's also a useful example of a Scala Android app.  Scala adds wrinkles to the Android setup, as its standard library is so large that it breaks Android's method limits, and needs to be tree-shaken with Proguard before deploying.  Still, I find it a really productive language for Android development when it's up and running.
