Hi!

These are some projects I've worked on recently - a mix of commercial and 'just for fun' stuff.

It's not intended to demo l33t hax0r skillz - I'm just interested in many areas of programming, and this site both gives me an outlet to explore that, and encourages me to finish up personal projects and open source them.

Enjoy :)
